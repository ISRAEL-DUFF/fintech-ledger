# Plan for Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) Engine

## Introduction

This document outlines the plan for implementing the Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) engine, a crucial component for orchestrating complex, multi-step financial workflows within the fintech wallet ledger system. This engine will address challenges related to atomicity across multiple transactions, state consistency, and liquidity management by providing a framework for bundling transactions and enabling sophisticated rollback and compensation mechanisms.

## High-Level Architecture

The CTE and CTEL engine will sit as a layer above the core Ledger System. Business applications will interact with the engine via an API, and the engine will in turn interact with the Ledger System's services (Transaction Service, Account Service, Wallet Service).

## Core Components

### 1. Event Coordinator (EC)
*   **Task:** Orchestrate the lifecycle of chained transaction events.
*   **Task:** Determine the optimal execution order and dependencies of transactions within an event.
*   **Task:** Coordinate resource allocation across transactions.
*   **Task:** Handle event queuing and prioritization.

### 2. Transaction Executor (TE)
*   **Task:** Execute transactions in the defined order (sequential and potentially parallel).
*   **Task:** Support parallel execution of independent transactions within an event.
*   **Task:** Monitor transaction progress and status.
*   **Task:** Manage transaction failures and exceptions, reporting them to the Rollback Manager.

### 3. Rollback Manager (RM)

### 4. State Manager (SM)
*   **Task:** Track the overall state and progress of each CTE event.
*   **Task:** Maintain individual transaction states within an event.
*   **Task:** Create recovery checkpoints to enable resuming failed events.
*   **Task:** Persist state information to an Event Store for durability and recovery.

### 5. Compensation Handler (CH)
*   **Task:** Define and implement the compensation logic for each type of transaction.
*   **Task:** Provide a mechanism to determine if a transaction can be compensated.
*   **Task:** Generate the necessary compensation transaction(s) for a given failed transaction.

### 6. Lien Manager (LM)
*   **Task:** Create CTE-aware lien entries in the Ledger System's Lien Service.
*   **Task:** Monitor the status and availability of liens within the context of specific CTEs.
*   **Task:** Manage the automatic release of liens upon CTE completion (successful or rolled back).
*   **Task:** Validate lien operations against the rules of the associated CTE.

### 7. Virtual Balance Manager (VBM)
*   **Task:** Calculate available balances of accounts, including amounts held under CTEL within the context of a specific CTE.
*   **Task:** Provide virtual balance views to CTE participants.
*   **Task:** Maintain balance isolation between different concurrent CTEs.
*   **Task:** Update virtual balance views in real-time as a CTE progresses.

### 8. CTE Coordinator (CC)
*   **Task:** Manage CTEL-enabled transaction events.
*   **Task:** Track all accounts participating in a CTEL.
*   **Task:** Resolve transaction dependencies within the CTEL context.
*   **Task:** Maintain consistent state across all CTEL operations.

### 9. Settlement Manager (SETTM)
*   **Task:** Finalize all transactions and CTELs upon successful CTE completion.
*   **Task:** Ensure actual balances are updated based on the completed transactions.

### 10. Risk Controller (RC)
*   **Task:** Implement risk assessment logic for CTEL operations.
*   **Task:** Validate CTEL transactions against defined risk rules.

### 11. Event Store (ES)
*   **Task:** Persist the state and history of all CTE events and associated transactions for auditing and recovery.

## CTE Execution Flow

The execution of a Chained Transaction Event follows a defined flow:

```

    EC["Event Creation"] --> VP["Validation Phase"]
    VP --> EP["Execution Phase"]
    EP --> MP["Monitor Phase"]
    MP --> CP["Completion Phase"]
    MP --> RP["Rollback Phase"]
    RP --> CP

    style EC fill:#e1f5fe
    style VP fill:#f3e5f5
    style EP fill:#e8f5e8
    style MP fill:#fff3e0
    style CP fill:#e8f5e8
    style RP fill:#ffebee
```
*   **Event Creation:** A new CTE event is initiated by a business application.
*   **Validation Phase:** The CTE engine validates the structure of the event, the validity of included transactions, and potentially checks initial account states or applies CTELs.
*   **Execution Phase:** The Transaction Executor executes the transactions within the event according to the plan.
*   **Monitor Phase:** The State Manager monitors the progress and state of the executing transactions.
*   **Completion Phase:** If all transactions succeed, the event enters the completion phase, and the Settlement Manager finalizes the changes.
*   **Rollback Phase:** If any transaction fails, the event enters the rollback phase, and the Rollback Manager uses the Compensation Handler to compensate for completed transactions.

## Key Features

*   **Atomic Operations:** Provides an all-or-nothing execution guarantee for a set of related transactions.
*   **Business Logic Decoupling:** Separates the complex transaction orchestration logic from individual business services.
*   **Flexible Rollback and Compensation:** Allows for sophisticated handling of failures and system errors.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Can avoid long-running database transactions for complex workflows by using a more distributed approach (Saga pattern).
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Designed to be resilient to failures with recovery mechanisms based on the persisted event state.
*   **Audit Trail:** The Event Store provides a comprehensive and immutable record of all CTE events and their execution.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to handle high throughput of complex transaction workflows.
*   **Conditional Execution:** Allows transactions within a chain to be executed only if specific conditions are met.
*   **Parallel Execution Groups:** Supports defining groups of independent transactions that can be executed concurrently.
*   **Saga Pattern Implementation:** Provides a framework for implementing long-running business processes as a sequence of local transactions with compensating transactions to handle failures.

## State Management

The State Manager will track the state of each CTE event and its individual transactions. The state transitions could be represented by a state machine:

```
mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CREATED
    CREATED --> VALIDATED
    VALIDATED --> EXECUTING
    EXECUTING --> COMPLETED
    EXECUTING --> FAILED
    FAILED --> ROLLING_BACK
    ROLLING_BACK --> ROLLED_BACK
    COMPLETED --> [*]
    ROLLED_BACK --> [*]

    note right of CREATED : Event initialized
    note right of VALIDATED : All transactions validated, CTELs applied
    note right of EXECUTING : Transactions in progress
    note right of COMPLETED : All transactions successful, CTELs released
    note right of FAILED : Transaction failure detected
    note right of ROLLING_BACK : Compensation in progress
    note right of ROLLED_BACK : All changes reverted, CTELs released
```
The State Manager will persist these states to the Event Store to enable recovery in case of system restarts.

## Integration with Core Ledger System

The CTE/CTEL engine will interact with the core Ledger System's services:

*   **CTE-Aware Transaction Service:** The core Transaction Service will need to be enhanced or a wrapper service created (`CTETransactionService`) to accept transaction requests from the CTE engine, potentially applying CTEL rules and interacting with the underlying database transactions.
*   **Compensation Handlers:** The core ledger system (or modules within it) will need to provide implementations of the `CompensationHandler` interface for different transaction types (e.g., compensating a debit is a credit).
*   **CTEL-Aware Account Service:** The Account Service will need to expose methods to retrieve balances that consider CTEL-locked and CTEL-available funds within the context of a specific CTE.
*   **CTEL Transaction Validation:** The validation logic for individual transactions will need to be aware of the CTEL context to ensure that operations comply with the lien rules and available virtual balances.

## Key Benefits

*   **Atomic Operations:** Ensures all-or-nothing execution across multiple transactions, even with distributed services.
*   **Business Logic Decoupling:** Separates transaction orchestration from individual service logic.
