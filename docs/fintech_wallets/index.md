# Fintech Wallet Ledger System Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a roadmap and index to the detailed implementation plan for the Fintech Wallet Ledger System, incorporating the Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) capabilities. The plan is broken down into stages, each focusing on specific components and functionalities.

## Implementation Stages

Here's an overview of each implementation stage and links to their detailed plans:

*   **Stage 1: Core Data Structures**
    *   Defines and implements the fundamental Go structs for Accounts, Entries, and Entry Lines, including fields relevant to a fintech wallet system and the new data structures required for CTE and CTEL.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-1-core-data-structures.md](stage-1-core-data-structures.md)

*   **Stage 2: Account Management**
    *   Focuses on implementing the core functionalities for managing accounts, including creation, retrieval, and updates. It also covers database schema design and the data access layer for accounts, considering the interaction with the CTE/CTEL engine.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-2-account-management.md](stage-2-account-management.md)

*   **Stage 3: Entry and Transaction Management**
    *   Details the implementation of creating and managing ledger entries and transactions. This stage focuses on the data structures, database schema, data access layer, and the crucial validation to ensure debits equal credits, with entry creation being orchestrated by the CTE engine.

*   **Stage 4: Wallet Operations**
    *   Outlines the implementation of core fintech wallet operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and handling fees. This stage focuses on how these operations are translated into ledger entries within the framework of Chained Transaction Events (CTEs) and potentially utilizing CTELs.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-4-wallet-operations.md](stage-4-wallet-operations.md)

*   **Stage 5: Balance and Reporting**
    *   Covers the implementation of calculating wallet balances and generating basic financial reports. This includes calculating balances considering CTEL-locked and CTEL-available funds to provide a "virtual balance" view, and adapting reporting to reflect CTEs and CTELs.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-5-balance-and-reporting.md](stage-5-balance-and-reporting.md)

*   **Stage 6: Concurrency and Data Integrity**
    *   Details the strategies and implementation tasks for handling concurrency and ensuring data integrity throughout the system, with a strong emphasis on the role of database transactions for individual transaction steps within a CTE and how the CTE/CTEL engine enhances these aspects for complex workflows.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-6-concurrency-and-data-integrity.md](stage-6-concurrency-and-integrity.md)

*   **Stage 7: Integrations and APIs**
    *   Focuses on designing and implementing the APIs for the ledger system and integrating with external services (like payment gateways and fraud detection). This includes designing APIs for interacting with the CTE/CTEL engine and clarifying how external integrations fit into the CTE framework.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-7-integrations-and-apis.md](stage-7-integrations-and-apis.md)

*   **Stage 8: Error Handling and Monitoring**
    *   Covers the implementation of robust error handling mechanisms and comprehensive monitoring for the system, with specific attention to handling errors and monitoring the state of Chained Transaction Events.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-8-error-handling-and-monitoring.md](stage-8-error-handling-and-monitoring.md)

*   **Stage 9: Testing and QA**
    *   Outlines the plan for thorough testing and quality assurance, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, with specific tasks for testing the CTE/CTEL engine and complex transaction scenarios.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-9-testing-and-qa.md](stage-9-testing-and-qa.md)

*   **Stage 10: Security**
    *   Details the tasks for implementing essential security measures to protect sensitive financial data, secure APIs, and ensure proper authorization, considering the security implications of the CTE/CTEL engine.
    *   [Detailed Plan: stage-10-security.md](stage-10-security.md)

## Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) Engine

A core component of this system is the CTE and CTEL engine, which orchestrates complex, multi-step transactions and manages liquidity with chained transaction event liens.
