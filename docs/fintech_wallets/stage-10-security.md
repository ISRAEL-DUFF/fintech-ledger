## Stage 10: Security Implementation

This stage focuses on implementing robust security measures to protect the sensitive financial data within the fintech wallet ledger system and ensure the integrity of operations.

### Tasks:

*   **Task: Data Encryption at Rest.**
    *   **Description:** Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., account balances, transaction amounts, any personally identifiable information if stored directly related to ledger entries).
    *   **Details:** Choose an appropriate encryption method and key management strategy. Ensure that encryption and decryption processes are handled securely within the application code or at the database level if supported.
    *   **Deliverables:** Code implementation for data encryption/decryption, documentation on encryption strategy.

*   **Task: Data Encryption in Transit.**
    *   **Description:** Ensure all communication with the ledger system (e.g., API calls) is secured using TLS/SSL.
    *   **Details:** Configure the application server and any relevant infrastructure (load balancers, API gateways) to enforce HTTPS. Ensure all internal service communication related to the ledger is also encrypted.
    *   **Deliverables:** Configuration files and code changes to enforce TLS/SSL.

*   **Task: API Authentication Implementation.**
    *   **Description:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for all API endpoints that interact with the ledger system.
    *   **Details:** This could involve API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWTs, or other appropriate methods. Ensure proper validation and handling of authentication credentials.
    *   **Deliverables:** Code implementation for authentication middleware or services, documentation on API authentication.

*   **Task: API Authorization Implementation.**
    *   **Description:** Implement granular authorization checks to ensure that authenticated users or services only have access to the resources and operations they are permitted to perform.
    *   **Details:** Define roles and permissions. Implement logic to check user/service permissions before executing ledger operations (e.g., preventing a user from accessing another user's wallet data).
    *   **Deliverables:** Code implementation for authorization logic, documentation on authorization model and permissions.

*   **Task: Input Validation and Sanitization.**
    *   **Description:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all data received by the ledger system's APIs and internal functions to prevent injection attacks and data integrity issues.
    *   **Details:** Validate data types, formats, ranges, and presence. Sanitize any user-provided input before processing or storing it.
    *   **Deliverables:** Code implementation for input validation and sanitization logic.

*   **Task: Secure Handling of Secrets and Credentials.**
    *   **Description:** Implement secure practices for managing and accessing sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, encryption keys).
    *   **Details:** Avoid storing secrets directly in code or configuration files. Utilize secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) and follow best practices for accessing them.
    *   **Deliverables:** Implementation of secret management integration, updated deployment procedures for secure credential handling.

*   **Task: Logging of Security Events.**
    *   **Description:** Implement logging for security-relevant events, such as failed authentication attempts, authorization failures, and suspicious activity.
    *   **Details:** Ensure logs include relevant information for security monitoring and incident response. Integrate with a centralized logging system.
    *   **Deliverables:** Code implementation for security event logging, configuration for logging system integration.

*   **Task: Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews.**
    *   **Description:** Establish a process for regular security audits and code reviews specifically focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities in the ledger system.
    *   **Details:** Conduct internal or external security assessments. Incorporate security checks into the development pipeline (e.g., static analysis tools).
    *   **Deliverables:** Defined process for security audits and code reviews, integration of security analysis tools.

*   **Task: Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling.**
    *   **Description:** Protect the API and critical operations from abuse and denial-of-service attacks by implementing rate limiting and throttling.
    *   **Details:** Configure rate limits based on API endpoint, user, or IP address.
    *   **Deliverables:** Configuration and code changes for rate limiting.
