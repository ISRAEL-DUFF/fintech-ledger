# Stage 4: Implementing Wallet Operations

This stage focuses on implementing the core financial operations within the fintech wallet system, specifically deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Each operation must be correctly translated into balanced double-entry ledger entries.

These operations will be implemented as transactions orchestrated by the Chained Transaction Events (CTE) engine, potentially utilizing Chained Transaction Event Liens (CTELs) for enhanced liquidity and complex workflows.


### Task 4.1: Implement Deposit Function

*   **Description:** Create a function `HandleDeposit(userID string, amount float64, currency string, source string)` that processes a deposit into a user's wallet.
*   **Details:**
    *   Retrieve the user's wallet `Account` based on `userID` and `currency`.
    *   Retrieve or create a system `Account` representing the deposit source (e.g., "Pending Deposits" or a specific payment gateway clearing account).
    *   Construct a new `Entry` with a descriptive `Description` (e.g., "Deposit from [source]").
    *   Create two `EntryLine`s for the `Entry`:
        *   A **Debit** to the source system account for the `amount`.
        *   A **Credit** to the user's wallet account for the `amount`.
    *   Ensure the `Debit` and `Credit` amounts in the entry lines are equal.
    *   Persist the `Entry` and its `EntryLine`s within a database transaction.
    *   Handle potential errors such as invalid user, invalid currency, or database transaction failures.
    *   **Integration with CTE:** This function will likely be initiated as a step within a larger CTE event, especially if the deposit process involves multiple stages (e.g., external payment gateway interaction, fraud checks).

### Task 4.2: Implement Withdrawal Function

*   **Description:** Create a function `HandleWithdrawal(userID string, amount float64, currency string, destination string)` that processes a withdrawal from a user's wallet.
*   **Details:**
    *   Retrieve the user's wallet `Account` based on `userID` and `currency`.
    *   Check if the user's wallet has sufficient balance for the `amount` and any associated fees (handled in Task 4.5). This check should ideally be done within the database transaction or with appropriate locking to prevent overdrafts in high concurrency scenarios.
    *   Retrieve or create a system `Account` representing the withdrawal destination (e.g., "Pending Withdrawals" or a specific payment gateway clearing account).
    *   Construct a new `Entry` with a descriptive `Description` (e.g., "Withdrawal to [destination]").
    *   Create two `EntryLine`s for the `Entry`:
        *   A **Debit** to the user's wallet account for the `amount`.
        *   A **Credit** to the destination system account for the `amount`.
    *   Ensure the `Debit` and `Credit` amounts in the entry lines are equal.
    *   Persist the `Entry` and its `EntryLine`s within a database transaction.
    *   Handle potential errors such as insufficient funds, invalid user, invalid currency, or database transaction failures.

    *   **Integration with CTE/CTEL:** Withdrawal operations are prime candidates for being part of a CTE, especially if they involve external systems or conditional releases. Consider how CTELs might be used to temporarily lock funds within the CTE context before the external withdrawal is confirmed.

### Task 4.3: Implement Transfer Function (Internal)

*   **Description:** Create a function `HandleInternalTransfer(senderUserID string, receiverUserID string, amount float64, currency string)` that processes a transfer between two users within the platform.
*   **Details:**
    *   Retrieve the sender's wallet `Account` and the receiver's wallet `Account` based on their `userID`s and `currency`.
    *   Check if the sender's wallet has sufficient balance for the `amount` and any associated fees (handled in Task 4.5). This check should be done within the database transaction or with appropriate locking.
    *   Construct a new `Entry` with a descriptive `Description` (e.g., "Transfer from [senderUserID] to [receiverUserID]").
    *   Create two `EntryLine`s for the `Entry`:
        *   A **Debit** to the sender's wallet account for the `amount`.
        *   A **Credit** to the receiver's wallet account for the `amount`.
    *   Ensure the `Debit` and `Credit` amounts in the entry lines are equal.
    *   Persist the `Entry` and its `EntryLine`s within a database transaction.
    *   Handle potential errors such as invalid sender/receiver, insufficient funds, invalid currency, or database transaction failures.

    *   **Integration with CTE/CTEL:** Internal transfers can also benefit from CTEs, particularly in scenarios involving multiple parties or conditional transfers. CTELs could be used to make the transferred amount "virtually" available to the receiver within the same CTE before the final settlement.

### Task 4.4: Implement Transfer Function (External - if applicable)

*   **Description:** (Optional) Create a function `HandleExternalTransfer(...)` for transfers involving external accounts (e.g., bank accounts).
*   **Details:**
    *   This will likely involve more complex entry structures, potentially using clearing accounts to represent funds in transit between the internal ledger and external systems.
    *   Design the specific entry structure to accurately reflect the movement of funds and ensure balancing.
    *   Integrate with external payment gateways or services for processing the external leg of the transfer.

    *   **Integration with CTE/CTEL:** External transfers are highly likely to be managed by the CTE engine due to their asynchronous nature and potential for external system failures. CTELs are crucial here for managing liquidity and making funds available in a controlled manner while the external transfer is in progress.

### Task 4.5: Implement Fee Handling

*   **Description:** Enhance the deposit, withdrawal, and transfer functions (or create a separate function called by them) to handle transaction fees.
*   **Details:**
    *   Define how fees are calculated ( fixed amount, percentage, or tiered).
    *   Retrieve a system `Account` designated for recording revenue from fees.
    *   When a fee is applied, create additional `EntryLine`s within the same transaction `Entry` or in a separate linked entry:
        *   A **Debit** to the user's wallet account (reducing their balance by the fee amount).
        *   A **Credit** to the system revenue account for the fee amount.
    *   Ensure the entire transaction (including the fee) remains balanced (Total Debits = Total Credits).
    *   Carefully consider the order of operations within the transaction to ensure the fee is debited before or concurrently with the main transaction amount, especially for withdrawals and transfers where insufficient funds might be an issue.

### Task 4.6: Add API Endpoints for Wallet Operations

*   **Description:** Create API endpoints (e.g., REST or gRPC) for initiating wallet operations *via the CTE engine*.

*   **Description:** Create API endpoints (e.g., REST or gRPC) for initiating deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations.
*   **Details:**
    *   Design the API request and response payloads.
    *   Implement input validation for all parameters (user IDs, amounts, currencies, etc.).
    *   Call the corresponding internal handling functions (Task 4.1 - 4.5).
    *   Instead of directly calling the internal handling functions, these API endpoints will interact with the **CTE Engine** to initiate a new Chained Transaction Event that encapsulates the desired wallet operation.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can perform operations on their wallets.
    *   Design the API to allow specifying parameters for CTEs, such as compensation logic details if applicable from the API caller's perspective.
