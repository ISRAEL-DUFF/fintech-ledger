# Stage 6: Concurrency Control and Data Integrity

This stage focuses on implementing robust concurrency control and ensuring the integrity of the ledger data, which is paramount for a financial system.

## Tasks

### Database Transactions Implementation

*   **Task:** Implement database transactions for all operations that modify the ledger state (creating entries, updating account balances).
    *   **Description:** Wrap all sequences of database writes that constitute a single logical operation (like creating an entry with multiple lines) within a single database transaction.
    *   **Details:** Use the database driver's transaction capabilities. Ensure proper error handling and transaction rollback in case of failures.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** All ledger modifications are atomic; either all parts of an operation succeed and are committed, or none are and the transaction is rolled back.
*   **Task:** Configure and understand database isolation levels.
    *   **Description:** Research and select an appropriate database isolation level (e.g., `Read Committed`, `Repeatable Read`, `Serializable`) for the ledger operations.
    *   **Details:** Understand the trade-offs between isolation levels in terms of concurrency and potential issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. Document the chosen isolation level and the rationale.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The chosen isolation level prevents data anomalies relevant to financial transactions under expected concurrency levels.

### Concurrency Conflict Handling

*   **Task:** Implement logic to handle potential concurrency conflicts (if applicable based on database/isolation level).
    *   **Description:** If using an isolation level or database that might result in transaction conflicts (e.g., due to optimistic concurrency control or high contention), implement retry logic or error handling mechanisms.
    *   **Details:** This might involve catching specific database errors related to serialization failures or unique constraint violations during concurrent writes and retrying the failed operation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The system can handle concurrent attempts to modify the same data without data corruption or unexpected errors for the user.

### Ensuring Debit-Credit Balance Integrity

## Concurrency with CTE/CTEL Engine

The introduction of the Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) engine significantly enhances how we handle concurrency and data integrity for complex workflows involving multiple steps and potential failures. While database transactions remain fundamental for atomic operations on individual ledger entries, the CTE/CTEL engine provides an orchestration layer for ensuring the consistency and correctness of multi-step processes.

### Orchestrated Concurrency

*   **Task:** Implement the CTE engine's Event Coordinator and Transaction Executor to manage the execution order and concurrency of transactions within a CTE.
    *   **Description:** Design the engine to handle dependencies between transactions in a chain, allowing for sequential or parallel execution where appropriate, while respecting concurrency limits.
    *   **Details:** The Event Coordinator manages the overall CTE lifecycle, and the Transaction Executor is responsible for executing individual transaction steps, often by interacting with the core ledger's transaction service (which uses database transactions).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The CTE engine correctly orchestrates the execution of transactions within a chain, respecting dependencies and configured concurrency settings.
*   **Task:** Leverage database transactions for individual transaction steps within a CTE.
    *   **Description:** Ensure that each individual transaction operation executed by the CTE engine (e.g., debiting one account and crediting another as part of a larger transfer CTE) is wrapped in its own database transaction.
    *   **Details:** This provides atomicity at the level of the single ledger entry, while the CTE engine provides atomicity and consistency at the level of the entire multi-step process.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** All modifications to account balances and creation of ledger entries within a CTE step are transactional at the database level.


*   **Task:** Implement validation to ensure that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits for every entry before persisting it.
    *   **Description:** Before saving an `Entry` to the database, iterate through its `EntryLine`s and calculate the total debit and total credit amounts.
    *   **Details:** If the total debits do not equal total credits, reject the entry creation and return an error. This validation should happen at the application layer before the database transaction is initiated.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** No entry with unbalanced debits and credits can be successfully saved to the ledger.
*   **Task:** Implement database constraints to enforce debit-credit balance (optional but recommended).
    *   **Description:** If the database supports it, define constraints (e.g., using triggers or assertions) that automatically check the debit and credit balance for an entry upon insertion or update.
    *   **Details:** This provides an additional layer of defense against data corruption, even if application-level validation is bypassed.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The database schema prevents the insertion of unbalanced entries.

### Data Consistency Checks

*   **Task:** Develop periodic data consistency checks.
    *   **Description:** Implement processes that periodically verify the integrity of the ledger data, such as ensuring that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits for all entries or checking that account balances reconcile with the sum of their entry lines.
    *   **Details:** These checks can run as background jobs and alert administrators to any discrepancies, which could indicate bugs or data corruption issues.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The system can automatically detect inconsistencies in the ledger data.
*   **Task:** Implement mechanisms for investigating and correcting data inconsistencies.
    *   **Description:** Define procedures and potentially tools to investigate the root cause of any detected data inconsistencies and safely apply corrections (e.g., through manual, auditable correction entries).
    *   **Details:** This is crucial for recovery in case of unexpected data issues.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** There is a defined process and capability to safely resolve data inconsistencies.
