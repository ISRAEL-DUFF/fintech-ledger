# Stage 7: Integrations and APIs (including CTE/CTEL Engine Interaction)

This stage focuses on making the fintech wallet ledger system accessible and interoperable with other services, both internal to the fintech platform and external.

## Tasks:

### 7.1 Design Internal APIs for Ledger Operations

*   Define the API endpoints, request payloads, and response structures for core ledger operations.
    *   **Task 7.1.1:** Design API endpoint and payload for creating a deposit (translates to ledger entry).
    *   **Task 7.1.2:** Design API endpoint and payload for initiating a withdrawal (translates to ledger entry, potentially involving a holding account).
    *   **Task 7.1.3:** Design API endpoint and payload for transferring funds between internal wallets (translates to a single ledger entry with two entry lines).
    *   **Task 7.1.4:** Design API endpoint and payload for retrieving a wallet's transaction history within a date range.
    *   **Task 7.1.5:** Design API endpoint and payload for retrieving a wallet's current balance.
    *   **Task 7.1.6:** Design API endpoint and payload for creating new user wallet accounts.
    *   **Task 7.1.7:** Design API endpoint and payload for retrieving account details by ID or User ID.
*   Implement request validation and serialization/deserialization for all API endpoints.

### 7.2 Implement Internal APIs

*   Write the code to handle incoming API requests, call the relevant ledger core functions (from previous stages), and return appropriate responses.
    *   **Task 7.2.1:** Implement the deposit API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.2:** Implement the withdrawal API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.3:** Implement the transfer API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.4:** Implement the transaction history API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.5:** Implement the balance retrieval API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.6:** Implement the account creation API endpoint handler.
    *   **Task 7.2.7:** Implement the account retrieval API endpoint handler.

### 7.3 Integrate with Payment Gateways

*   Develop modules or services to interact with external payment gateways for processing deposits and initiating withdrawals. These integrations will primarily initiate Chained Transaction Events (CTEs) to ensure atomicity and proper ledger updates.
    *   **Task 7.3.1:** Design the interface or contract for a generic payment gateway integration module.
    *   **Task 7.3.2:** Implement integration logic for a specific deposit method (e.g., credit card, bank transfer). This integration will initiate a CTE that includes the ledger entry for crediting the user's wallet (potentially from a holding account) and other related actions. Handle webhooks or callbacks for payment confirmation within the CTE framework.
    *   **Task 7.3.3:** Implement integration logic for a specific withdrawal method. This integration will initiate a CTE that includes the ledger entry for debiting the user's wallet (potentially to a holding account) and coordinating the payout via the payment gateway. Handle asynchronous responses and potential failures within the CTE's rollback and compensation mechanisms.
    *   **Task 7.3.4:** Refine the process for creating ledger entries corresponding to successful deposit and withdrawal transactions initiated via payment gateways, ensuring these are performed as steps within a CTE. This will involve using holding accounts and potentially CTELs for managing funds during the asynchronous parts of the process.

### 7.4 Integrate with Fraud Detection Systems

*   Integrate with fraud detection services to assess the risk of transactions, potentially as a step within a CTE.
    *   **Task 7.4.1:** Design the integration point for sending transaction or CTE details to the fraud detection system.
    *   **Task 7.4.2:** Implement the logic to receive responses from the fraud detection system (e.g., score, recommendations) as part of a CTE. Based on the assessment, the CTE can proceed, be held, or trigger a rollback if fraud is detected.
    *   **Task 7.4.3:** Define how fraud-related events are recorded in the ledger. This might involve adding metadata to existing entries within a CTE or creating new entries (potentially within a compensating CTE) if a transaction is confirmed fraudulent and needs reversal.

### 7.5 Design and Implement APIs for the CTE/CTEL Engine

*   Design and implement APIs that allow other services to interact with the Chained Transaction Events (CTE) and Chained Transaction Event Lien (CTEL) engine.
    *   **Task 7.5.1:** Design API endpoint and payload for initiating a new Chained Transaction Event, specifying the sequence of transactions and their dependencies.
    *   **Task 7.5.2:** Design API endpoint and payload for querying the current state and progress of a specific CTE.
    *   **Task 7.5.3:** Design API endpoint and payload for creating and managing CTELs within the context of a CTE.
    *   **Task 7.5.4:** Design API endpoint and payload for querying virtual balances, considering active CTELs within a specific CTE context.
    *   **Task 7.5.5:** Implement the handlers for the CTE/CTEL engine APIs, interacting with the core components of the engine.

*   Develop modules or services to interact with external payment gateways for processing deposits and initiating withdrawals.
    *   **Task 7.3.1:** Design the interface or contract for a generic payment gateway integration module.
    *   **Task 7.3.2:** Implement integration logic for a specific deposit method (e.g., credit card, bank transfer), including handling webhooks or callbacks for payment confirmation.
    *   **Task 7.3.3:** Implement integration logic for a specific withdrawal method, including handling asynchronous responses and potential failures.
    *   **Task 7.3.4:** Design and implement the process for creating ledger entries corresponding to successful deposit and withdrawal transactions initiated via payment gateways. This may involve using holding accounts.

### 7.4 Integrate with Fraud Detection Systems

*   Implement robust error handling for all API interactions and external integrations.
    *   **Task 7.6.1:** Define a consistent error response format for the APIs.
    *   **Task 7.6.2:** Implement error handling logic within API handlers and integration modules to catch errors from the ledger core, database, or external services and return informative error responses.
    *   **Task 7.6.3:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors when interacting with external services.

### 7.7 API Documentation

*   Implement mechanisms to secure the internal and potentially external APIs, including the new CTE/CTEL engine APIs.
    *   **Task 7.7.1:** Choose an appropriate authentication mechanism (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    *   **Task 7.7.2:** Implement the authentication middleware or logic for validating API requests for both core ledger and CTE/CTEL endpoints.
    *   **Task 7.7.3:** Define and implement authorization rules to ensure that services or users can only perform actions they are permitted to, considering permissions related to initiating CTEs, managing CTELs, and accessing CTE state.

### 7.8 Error Handling for Integrations and APIs

*   Implement robust error handling for all API interactions and external integrations, including interactions with the CTE/CTEL engine.
    *   **Task 7.8.1:** Define a consistent error response format for all APIs, including specific error codes or details related to CTE/CTEL execution failures or conflicts.
    *   **Task 7.8.2:** Implement error handling logic within API handlers and integration modules to catch errors from the ledger core, database, external services, and the CTE/CTEL engine and return informative error responses.
    *   **Task 7.8.3:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors when interacting with external services, potentially coordinated by the CTE engine's retry policies.

*   Create clear and comprehensive documentation for all internal APIs.
    *   **Task 7.7.1:** Use an API documentation tool (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) to document endpoints, parameters, responses, and error codes.
