# Stage 8: Error Handling and Monitoring

This stage focuses on implementing comprehensive error handling and monitoring to ensure the reliability and observability of the fintech wallet ledger system.

## 8.1 Define and Implement Custom Error Types

*   **Task:** Define a set of custom error types in Go to represent specific error conditions within the ledger system (e.g., `ErrInsufficientFunds`, `ErrAccountNotFound`, `ErrInvalidEntry`, `ErrDatabaseError`, `ErrIntegrationError`).
*   **Task:** Ensure custom error types include relevant context (e.g., account ID, entry ID, transaction type) to aid debugging.
*   **Task:** Implement error wrapping where appropriate to preserve the original error while adding context.

## 8.2 Implement Robust Error Handling in Operations

*   **Task:** Review all functions and methods that interact with the database and external services.
*   **Task:** Implement error checking and handling for all potential failure points, including:
    *   Database connection errors.
    *   Database query execution errors (e.g., constraint violations, deadlocks).
    *   Errors from external API calls (e.g., payment gateway failures, timeouts).
    *   Validation errors (e.g., invalid input, insufficient funds).
    *   Concurrency conflicts.
*   **Task:** Ensure errors are propagated correctly up the call stack.
*   **Task:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., temporary database connection issues) where appropriate, with exponential backoff.

## 8.3 Implement Logging

*   **Task:** Choose and integrate a structured logging library (e.g., Zap, Logrus).
*   **Task:** Implement logging at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) throughout the application.
*   **Task:** Log key events and data points, including:
    *   Start and end of significant operations (e.g., transaction processing).
    *   Input parameters and output results for operations.
    *   Details of all errors, including custom error types and wrapped errors.
    *   Information about external service calls and their responses.
    *   Security-related events (e.g., failed authentication attempts).
*   **Task:** Ensure logs include relevant correlation IDs (e.g., request ID, transaction ID) to trace requests across the system.
*   **Task:** Configure logging output format (e.g., JSON) for easy parsing by logging aggregation systems.

## 8.4 Implement Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Task:** Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic).
*   **Task:** Instrument the code to collect key metrics, including:
    *   Request rate and latency for API endpoints.
    *   Database query performance and error rates.
    *   Error rates for external service calls.
    *   Number of successful and failed transactions.
    *   Queue sizes if asynchronous processing is used.
    *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory, network).
*   **Task:** Set up dashboards to visualize key metrics.
*   **Task:** Configure alerts based on predefined thresholds for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, increased latency, low disk space).
*   **Task:** Implement health check endpoints for the service.

## 8.5 Implement Transaction Monitoring and Reconciliation

*   **Task:** Develop tools or processes to monitor the status of ongoing transactions, especially those involving external systems.
*   **Task:** Implement a reconciliation process to periodically compare the state of the ledger with external systems (e.g., payment gateway records) to identify and resolve discrepancies.
*   **Task:** Log and alert on any discrepancies found during reconciliation.

## 8.7 Error Handling within the CTE/CTEL Engine

*   **Task:** Define specific error types for the CTE/CTEL engine (e.g., `ErrCTEDependencyFailure`, `ErrCTERollbackFailed`, `ErrCTELienConflict`).
*   **Task:** Implement robust error handling within the CTE execution flow, specifically during the execution of individual transaction steps.
*   **Task:** Ensure that errors occurring during CTE execution trigger the appropriate rollback and compensation logic managed by the Rollback Manager.
*   **Task:** Handle errors that might occur during the rollback or compensation process itself, implementing retry mechanisms where appropriate.
*   **Task:** Implement error handling for CTEL operations, such as lien creation or release failures.

## 8.8 Monitoring the CTE/CTEL Engine

*   **Task:** Implement logging specifically for the CTE/CTEL engine, tracking the state transitions of each CTE event (CREATED, VALIDATED, EXECUTING, COMPLETED, FAILED, ROLLING_BACK, ROLLED_BACK).
*   **Task:** Log details of individual transaction execution within a CTE, including success, failure, and any errors encountered.
*   **Task:** Log details of rollback and compensation operations.
*   **Task:** Instrument the CTE/CTEL engine to collect metrics on:
    *   Number of active CTEs, categorized by state.
    *   Rate of CTE creation and completion.
    *   Rate of CTE failures and successful rollbacks.
    *   Latency of CTE execution.
*   **Task:** Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts for the CTE/CTEL engine to provide visibility into its health and performance, and to alert on failed or stuck CTEs.
## 8.6 Testing Error Handling and Monitoring

*   **Task:** Write unit tests to verify that functions handle expected error conditions correctly.
*   **Task:** Write integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios, including database errors and external service failures, and verify that error handling and logging work as expected.
*   **Task:** Test monitoring and alerting configurations to ensure they trigger correctly under error conditions.
