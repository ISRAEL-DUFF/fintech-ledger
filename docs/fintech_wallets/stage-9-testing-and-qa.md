    -   *Details:* Test how the ledger system behaves when fraud signals are received or sent.

-   **Task:** Implement integration tests for the CTE/CTEL engine's interaction with the database (persisting CTE/CTEL state, retrieving related entries).
    -   *Details:* Use a test database instance to verify that CTE and CTEL states and related entries are correctly stored and retrieved.
-   **Task:** Implement integration tests for executing simple, multi-step CTEs involving core wallet operations.
    -   *Details:* Define a CTE with a few sequential transactions (e.g., transfer + fee deduction) and verify that all steps are executed correctly and the final ledger state is consistent.


## 9.3 End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate user flows to verify the entire system from the user interface (or API) to the database.

-   **Task:** Implement end-to-end tests for the deposit workflow.
    -   *Details:* Simulate a user initiating a deposit and verify that the correct entry is created in the ledger and the wallet balance is updated.

    -   *Details:* Simulate a user initiating a withdrawal and verify the resulting ledger entry and balance update.
-   **Task:** Implement end-to-end tests for the transfer workflow between two users.
    -   *Details:* Simulate a transfer and verify that both the sender's and receiver's wallets are updated correctly with corresponding debit and credit entries.
-   **Task:** Implement end-to-end tests for fee deduction scenarios.
    -   *Details:* Test operations that involve fees and verify that the fee is correctly debited from the user's wallet and credited to a system revenue account.
